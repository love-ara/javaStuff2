Functional interface: must have only one abstract method.
The functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. You can use lambda expressions to create instances of this interface.

public interface name{
   public abstract returnType methodName(Optional parameters);
}

The @FunctionalInterface annotation is an annotation in the Java Lang package that is used to identify an interface as a functional interface.

@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    public abstract void method();
}
